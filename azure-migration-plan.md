# Azure Migration Plan - Benefits Assistant Chatbot

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive migration from Firebase/Google Cloud to Azure services for the Benefits Assistant Chatbot platform.

## Current State Analysis
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth → Azure Active Directory B2C
- **Database**: Firestore → Azure Cosmos DB
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage → Azure Blob Storage
- **Functions**: Firebase Functions → Azure Functions
- **AI/ML**: Vertex AI → Azure OpenAI Service
- **Logging**: Google Cloud Logging → Azure Monitor
- **Cache**: Redis → Azure Cache for Redis
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting → Azure Static Web Apps

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
1. Create Azure Resource Group
2. Set up Azure Active Directory B2C
3. Configure Azure Cosmos DB
4. Set up Azure Blob Storage
5. Configure Azure Cache for Redis
6. Set up Azure Monitor

### Phase 2: Authentication Migration (Week 1-2)
1. Replace Firebase Auth with Azure AD B2C
2. Update authentication middleware
3. Migrate user data
4. Update frontend auth components

### Phase 3: Database Migration (Week 2)
1. Design Cosmos DB schema
2. Create migration scripts
3. Migrate data from Firestore
4. Update data access layer

### Phase 4: Storage Migration (Week 2-3)
1. Migrate files to Azure Blob Storage
2. Update file upload/download logic
3. Update document processing pipeline

### Phase 5: AI/ML Migration (Week 3)
1. Set up Azure OpenAI Service
2. Migrate from Vertex AI
3. Update embedding generation
4. Update RAG system

### Phase 6: Functions Migration (Week 3-4)
1. Convert Firebase Functions to Azure Functions
2. Update triggers and bindings
3. Deploy and test functions

### Phase 7: Monitoring & Logging (Week 4)
1. Set up Azure Monitor
2. Configure Application Insights
3. Set up alerts and dashboards

### Phase 8: Deployment & Testing (Week 4-5)
1. Set up Azure Static Web Apps
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. End-to-end testing
4. Performance optimization

## Cost Estimation (Monthly)
- Azure Cosmos DB: $50-200
- Azure Blob Storage: $20-50
- Azure Functions: $20-100
- Azure OpenAI Service: $300-1,000
- Azure Cache for Redis: $30-150
- Azure Monitor: $20-100
- Azure Static Web Apps: $0-50
- **Total**: $440-1,650/month

## Risk Mitigation
1. Parallel running of both systems during migration
2. Comprehensive testing at each phase
3. Rollback plan for each component
4. Data backup and validation
5. Gradual user migration

## Success Criteria
1. All functionality working on Azure
2. Performance equal or better than Firebase
3. Cost within budget constraints
4. Security and compliance maintained
5. Zero data loss during migration
